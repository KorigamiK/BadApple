The internet challenge of playing the [Bad Apple!! PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) on as many platforms and interfaces as possible

As the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the "Bad Apple!!" remix by Alstroemeria Records featuring nomico happens, this small project celebrates its repute.

See the _Bad Apple!! PV_ playing in your browser's favicon as you navigate to the website with the lyrics :D

The project can easily be extended to any video or a series of images. It's using OpenCV's glorious API to figure out the frame.
